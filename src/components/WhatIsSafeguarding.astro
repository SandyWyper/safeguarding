        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Safeguarding is the protection of children, young people, and
          vulnerable adults from abuse, neglect, and harm. It's about creating
          safe environments where everyone can thrive and reach their full
          potential.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          Our commitment to safeguarding means ensuring that all individuals are
          protected from any form of abuse, whether physical, emotional, or
          psychological.
