# Individual Formative Assignment

---

### Front-End Design

I used chat_GPT and Gemini to expand on this criteria. It provided a detailed plan for building out each section, making sure to explain how each section responds on different screen sizes.

I even got chatGPT to format the plan into markdown.

The file can be found in the root of the directory - [WireFrameChat.md](WireFrameChat.md)

### Purpose

The purpose of this website is to provide clear and easy-to-understand information on safeguarding practices, including how to recognize and respond to safeguarding concerns. It aims to educate users on the key principles of safeguarding in a simple and intuitive manner.

### User Value

**Empowerment through Knowledge:**

- _Increased Awareness:_ Users gain a clear understanding of what safeguarding means, helping them to be more aware of potential risks to themselves or others.
- _Ability to Recognize Concerns:_ The site will equip users with the knowledge to identify signs of abuse, neglect, or other safeguarding issues, even if subtle.
- _Confidence to Act:_ By outlining response procedures, the site empowers users to know what steps to take when a concern arises, rather than feeling helpless or unsure.

**Safety and Well-being:**

- _Protection for Vulnerable Individuals:_ For individuals who may be at risk or experiencing harm, the site provides crucial information on how to seek help or how others can report concerns on their behalf.
- _Safer Environments:_ When more people understand and practice good safeguarding principles, it contributes to the creation of safer environments in communities, workplaces, and homes.
- _Prevention of Harm:_ By understanding proactive safeguarding measures, users can contribute to preventing harm from occurring in the first place.

**Clarity and Accessibility:**

- _Easy-to-Understand Information:_ The simple and intuitive layout ensures that complex safeguarding concepts are presented in a digestible way, making it accessible to a wide audience regardless of their prior knowledge.
- _Quick Reference:_ The structured content allows users to quickly find specific information they need, whether it's about recognizing a particular type of concern or understanding reporting procedures.
- _Reduced Anxiety/Confusion:_ In situations where safeguarding concerns arise, the site provides a clear pathway for action, reducing anxiety and confusion for those who need to respond.

**Ethical and Legal Compliance (for some users):**

- _Meeting Responsibilities:_ For individuals in roles that require safeguarding knowledge (e.g., volunteers, community workers, parents), the site helps them understand and meet their ethical and potentially legal responsibilities.
- _Promoting Best Practice:_ By providing clear guidelines, the site encourages the adoption of best safeguarding practices across various contexts.

### Deployment

Followed the instruction in the [astro docs.](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/github/)

1. Update `astro.config.hjs`
2. Configure a gitHub Action to build to the site ( making sure to reference the correct branch name )
3. In GitHub Pages settings, under Build and Deployment, select GitHub Actions.

Now every time the remote repository on that branch receives an update the site will automatically build and deploy.
